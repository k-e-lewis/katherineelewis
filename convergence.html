        <p>A Young Adult Fantasy Book Series by Katherine E. Lewis & Rebecca Lewis. It follows Mera Kellen, a sixteen-year-old girl who discovers she is an Elemental- a being that can derive the ability to manipulate energy from the four elements. Because being a teenager isn't complicated enough. Sent to live with her grandmother, Ida Kellen, in the isolated village of Convergence, Maine after her mom goes missing, Mera is thrust into the mysterious world of Elementals and experiences its dangers firsthand. Like monsters that stalk Elementals and feed on their energy. A turbulent community plagued by fear, prejudices, and outdated traditions. And maybe worst of all, a high school full of hormonal, energy-manipulating teenagers.</p><p>Being a Kellen only makes life harder for Mera in Convergence, as her great-aunt, Darcy Kellen- an ultra-powerful and rare fifth kind of Elemental called an Aether- went on a killing spree in the village decades ago. But hey, what family doesn't have a power-hungry sociopath, right?</p><p>When Mera learns she, too, is an Aether, she fears her power will destroy those she loves. With the help of her grandmother and newly made friends, Mera must discover who she is, what she stands for, and where she truly belongs.</p>

            <p class="bookonereview">"I grew up reading YA fantasy, and it was so disheartening to see the female characters pushed to the side again and again. Well, this book changes all that. Bold, strong, flawed, powerful girls and women fill this book, taking the reader on a true journey of discovery, from the main character Mera uncovering the truth about her family’s past, to understanding a new world of magic and elemental powers that dictate every facet of life in the small Maine town she moves to after her mother suddenly goes missing.</p><p class="bookonereview">If you love YA fantasy, you've got to read this book. It features a unique new world of magic and characters you can't help but fall in love with, along with some truly bone-chilling moments where the main characters come face to face with darkness." - Justina Huddleston, Writer (SheKnows.com)

        <h2 class=booktwotitle>Convergence- Book Two: Ascension</h2>
        <p class="booktwodescription">Coming in 2023... It's been three months since Darcy's return rocked Convergence, but Mera is no closer to having her mom back than when Genevieve first went missing; worse is now knowing that her mom is the prisoner of her murderous great-aunt Darcy. Although Mera's relationship with Ida has strengthened, her friendships are more complicated. Ani is distant and avoids Mera at every turn, while Wyatt and Mera grow closer than ever. But Mera has a secret she's never told them— a betrayal she knows could come in between the trio for good.</p><p>Meanwhile, Convergence is as divided as ever since Darcy's return, with the townspeople living in fear of her next attack. Ida is adamant that no one find out that Mera is also an Aether, like Darcy—an incredibly powerful and long-feared type of Elemental— as there's no telling what the scared villagers may do if they knew. The town's troubles continue to grow, as rumors swirl of an approaching prophesied event— a night when an army of creatures will attack the village to feast on the energy of the Elementals, destroying Convergence for good.</p><p>While everyone is focused on the obvious threats of Darcy and the creatures, a looming danger is lurking ever closer, unnoticed— a danger that sweeps up Mera and her friends, bringing Mera heartbreaking revelations and leaving only tragedy in its wake.</p>
